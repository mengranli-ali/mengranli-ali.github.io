## Grouping Data

**Basic Clauses:**
- `GROUP BY` – show you how to group rows into groups based on columns or expressions.
- `HAVING` – filter the groups by a specific condition.
- `ROLLUP` –  generate multiple grouping sets considering a hierarchy between columns specified in the GROUP BY clause.
